[[overview]]
= Overview

HSL Park and Ride application contains information about parking facilities near public transportation hubs.
Data is provided free-or-charge with XXX License.


[[authentication]]
= Authentication

Mutable operations require authentication using the `Authorization` header as shown in the following example.
The value is the string `Bearer` followed by the API user's token.

include::{generated}/authentication-example/http-request.adoc[]

NOTE: Authentication is *not* needed for read-only (GET) methods.


[[supported-formats]]
= Supported Formats

Both JSON and http://geojson.org[GeoJSON] (Feature/FeatureCollection) are supported for facilities and hubs.
In JSON format locations are provided using GeoJSON Geometries (Point or Polygon).
GeoJSON's feature centric view contains only basic metadata of given entity.

Required format is specified either with `.json` or `.geojson` suffix or by using `Accept` header with
`application/json` or `application/vnd.geo+json` value.
If no suffix or `Accept` header is given, JSON is used by default.

TODO: CURL-examples using .json or .geojson AND headers alternatives.

[[searching]]Â 
= General Search Features

While simple listings (e.g. enums) may return arrays of values directly, searches return results
that are wrapped within an object. This result object has boolean field `hasMore` that indicates whether
or not there's more result rows available:

[source,json]
----
{
  "results": [...]
  "hasMore": false
}
----

Search API's accept order specifier via `sort.by` and `sort.dir` parameters.
Direction is given as `ASC` or `DESC`. Allowed values of `sort.by` depend on API but typically
it supports at least `name.fi`, `name.sv` and `name.en`

CURL-EXAMPLE!


[[localization]]
= Localization

Park and Ride data is localized in Finnish, Swedish and English.
Localized fields are represented as objects with `fi`, `sv` and `en` fields:

[source,json]
----
{
  "name": {
    "fi": "Nimi",
    "sv": "Namn",
    "en": "Name"
  }
}
----

Optional localized fields are either `null` or localized for all supported languages.
For example missing (optional) info:

[source,json]
----
{
  "info": null
}
----


[[enumerations]]
= Enumerations

Park and Ride utilizes enumerated values for much of it's metadata. Current value-sets are available via REST.

CapacityType defines different kind of parking slot types:

EXAMPLE!

DayType, a rough categorization of day types with different opening hours and/or pricing:

EXAMPLE!

Services provided by parking facility:

EXAMPLE!

PaymentMethods accepted by facility:

EXAMPLE!

FacilityStatuses:

EXAMPLE!

PricingMethod is a short-cut for maintaining actual facility pricing information:

EXAMPLE!


[[operators]]
= Operators

All facilities are operated by an operator. Operator can be listed with:

EXAMPLE!

Details (i.e. localized name) of an operator can be fetched with:

EXAMPLE!


[[contacts]]
= Contacts

Facilities have emergency, operator and (optional) service contacts. Contacts are either general,
maintained by HSL and shared by all operators, or operator specific. Operator specific contacts have
`operatorId` property.

Contacts can be searched with optional `ids` [0..n] and `operatorId` [0..1] parameters:

EXAMPLE!


Contact details can fetched by id:
